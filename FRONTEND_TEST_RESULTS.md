## 16. Known Issues & Bugs

### Issue #1: Processors Overlapping at (0,0)
**Status**: üêõ OPEN
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: All processors created have position (0,0), causing overlap
**Impact**: Cannot see individual processors without moving them
**Workaround**: Manually move processors after creation
**Fix Required**: Backend should auto-position or frontend should set positions

### Issue #2: No Processor Positioning Saved
**Status**: üêõ OPEN
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: Processor positions not persisted to backend
**Impact**: Positions reset on page reload
**Workaround**: None
**Fix Required**: Backend needs to store and return x,y positions

### Issue #3: No Visual Feedback for Running Flow
**Status**: üí° ENHANCEMENT
**Severity**: Low
**Description**: No visual indication when flow is running vs stopped
**Impact**: User cannot tell processor state
**Enhancement**: Add processor state colors (running=green, stopped=gray, error=red)
